Communication of physical, chemical and microbiological analyzes from LAB/Olive via EPCIS v2

This project consists of the implementation of the [EPCIS versión 2](https://github.com/gs1/EPCIS) protocol for the communication of the physical-chemical and microbiological analytical values from the LAB/Olive program.
